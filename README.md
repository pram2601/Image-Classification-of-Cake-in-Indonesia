# Image Classification of Cake in Indonesia

Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop an image classification system capable of identifying different types of cakes in Indonesia. The system will use deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to recognize and differentiate various Indonesian cake types from input images.

Project Output:

The final output of this project will be a fully trained image classification model that can accept images of Indonesian cakes as input and provide corresponding class labels indicating the identified cake type.

Brief Explanation of the Data Used:

The project will utilize a dataset consisting of images of various Indonesian cakes. Each image will be labeled with the corresponding cake type, forming the ground truth for model training and evaluation.

Method Used:

The project will employ a deep learning approach, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image classification. CNNs are well-suited for image-related tasks, as they can automatically learn and detect hierarchical patterns and features from the images, leading to accurate classification.

Project Advantages:

    Business Applications: The classification system can be utilized in the culinary industry for marketing purposes, menu suggestions, and customer recommendations.
    High Accuracy: The use of deep learning techniques, especially CNNs, enables the model to capture intricate features, resulting in higher accuracy for cake classification.

Project Limitations:

    Computational Resources: Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive, and the project may require substantial computational resources to achieve optimal results.
    Dataset Size: The performance of the model heavily relies on the quantity and quality of the dataset. If the dataset is limited or imbalanced, it may affect the model's accuracy and generalization capability.
